Overview: To make a drone parts planner site inspired in part by PC parts planner but also rendered in 3d using React One Three Fiber (React and Three.js)

Components:Header

Have orbit controls tied to a prebuilt model that rotates on the left of the screen, you scroll down and it rotates and there is a description of the site as you scroll 
The description or body says WELCOME and as you scroll down the welcome fades out. The body contains instructions on how to build the site and 
at the bottom of the body there is a button that says GET STARTED with a blinking Black arrow above it pointing at the bottom. The arrow only starts to blink when you reach the bottom of the description

Has an estimated cost counter at the top right of the build

        Step One: Choose your frame 
        Step Two: Pick your Flight Controller
        Step Three: Choose your motor
            (When picking the motor it zooms in on the frame location where the motor would be and stops the auto rotate)
        Step Four: Props; Bi-blade, Tri-blade, Quad etc and Color 
        Step Five: Accessorize. Choose Racing fins, Go Pro mounts, motor guards, colors, LEDs

Steps:Test to see how easy it is for you to import a drone frame into the website
Follow along to this tutorial: https://youtu.be/Qs9A3XIjbg4
To see how to import a model into your website. Store each model in their own component file
Create a fully built model to use as the rotating background. Tie orbit Controls to scrolling down.

Step 1: Add gltf files to public folder. CHECK
Step 2: Learn how to position the camera and object so that I can see it.

Okay so I imported Orbit controls which helps me move my object
I can try and figure out where exactly the object positions on the canvas by default and the canvas size.
Figure out how to use padding to position the canvas lower on the page.
useHelpers like CameraHelper

Add cards to click on for prebuilt models and then have a build your own model below it.
"Already know exactly what parts you would like? See our parts prices list." 

Have a component built that shows the final price with the prices of each piece listed above it. Like a receipt.
